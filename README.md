## Technologeis and plugins

- Webpack
- Webpack CLI
- Html Webpack Plugin
- Webpack Dev Server
- Style Loader
- CSS Loader
- Sass Loader
- Sass

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project by runing the `git clone git@github.com:aimalamiri/Webpack-boilerplate.git` command in your command line.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` for development mode `npm run build` for production mode and `npm run start` for runing the web server.

## Directory Structure

1. ** src ** directory is hosting all of the project files
2. `src/index.html` is the main html file
3. `src/index.js` file is the entry point in the webpack configuration
4. Put all of your styles in `src/scss` directory for decoupling the code.
